- add function for 16-bit PWMs
- analog read
- read and write methods similar to PWM.write() and PWM.write_to_pin_number()
- figure out how to reduce the boilerplate of having to declare twice whether a pin is for input or output,  in the `setup_pins` function and the `PinMap` struct
- proper usage instructions
- implement https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal/blob/main/examples/arduino-uno/src/bin/uno-simple-pwm.rs
